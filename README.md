# 🕵️ BRENCH SUSPECT – Suspicious Activity Detection from CCTV Footage

## 📌 Project Overview

**BRENCH SUSPECT** is an intelligent surveillance system that uses the **Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN)** model to detect suspicious human activities from CCTV footage. The project leverages deep learning techniques with **Keras** and **TensorFlow** in Python to automatically monitor public and private spaces, ensuring public safety by identifying abnormal behaviors based on visual patterns.
